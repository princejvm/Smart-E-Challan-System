What
e-challan is a special Android app devised by the traffic police to simplify the process of imposing and collecting spot fines against traffic offenders. The app works on smart phones, tabs and computers, online and offline

How
Traffic cops at various intersections will be given phones or tabs preloaded with the software for imposing spot fines. Once the app, which comes with all sections of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, is opened, the policeman on duty will simply have to key in details like vehicle registration number, driver's name and phone number, and select the nature of offence.
All details are subsequently saved in the police force's central server. A message will immediately reach the traffic violator with details of the nature of offence and fine

On-offline
"The system works online as well as offline to address Net connectivity problems. In case of offline, the data is stored locally and not immediately in the central server.

Payment
Fines can be paid at all pragya kendras or at the traffic control room. But, in case of an  emergency, i.e. if an offender isn't a resident of native place, he/she can pay directly to a traffic policeman who will then tap on the "paid" option in the app. This gets saved in real time and a message will be delivered to the offender
